Dr. Goins reported that the Congress was very beneficial and has one of the best trustee trainings you can get. Don reported that he attended a workshop regarding \"students too distressed to learn'. Issues that affect Students learning includes food and housing security. These issues significantly affect students' mental health. Nationally the ratio of counselors to students at community college is 1 to 3,000. The ICCTA Board of Representatives will be meeting later this week in Naperville, IL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePRESIDENT'S REPORT\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTim Bellamey's written report:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI attended the Council of Presidents retreat on October 20\" and 21\" in Peoria. We received legal updates regarding community colleges. Among the items noted was Public Act 99-063, which limits outgoing boards of trustees from entering into a new employment agreement with a president, chancellor, or CEO, prior to the new board being sworn in. The blackout period begins 45 days prior to the Tuesday following the first Monday in April in oddnumbered years and extends until the first organizational meeting of the new board. There is an emergency exception to the new law. The new travel expense control act was also discussed. This law requires boards to set limits on travel reimbursements for meals, hotel, airfare, etc. Any expense above the limits must be approved by board action before the reimbursement will occurs. We are currently drafting our policy and will present it for approval at the December meeting. We also discussed the proposed bachelor of science in nursing for community colleges. It appears that ICCTA and ICCB support moving forward with legislation to allow community colleges to offer the BSN. I expect legislation will be proposed in the spring legislative session. The universities have indicated they will vigorously oppose this legislation so I the likelihood of passage is uncertain at best. I attended the SICCM Board of Directors meeting on October 25\". We discussed at length options for the future operation of SICCM as well as the status of each program. Currently there are four programs operated through SICCM: Occupational Therapy Assistant, Surgical Technology, Medical Lab Technician, and Veterinary Technician. The Occupational Therapy program has the largest enrollment but the field is becoming saturated and employment options are declining. The Medical Lab Technician program is the highest demand field but enrollment is typically low. We have withdrawn from the Veterinary Technician program leaving only Rend Lake and John A. Logan active in the program. The feedback from hospitals regarding surgical technology is that they prefer training registered\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\fnurses for those jobs. In summary it appears the Veterinary Technology and Surgical Technology programs could be dropped leaving only the Occupational Therapy and Medical Laboratory Technician programs as viable options. I have indicated, as have the president's of Kaskaskia, Rend Lake, and Southeastern Illinois College that we cannot afford to financially support SICCM as it is currently constituted. We currently have class and program sharing agreements with SIC and Rend Lake that could allow us to provide joint programming should we decide not to continue as a member of the consortium in the future. These agreements can also be used to create new program opportunities. I will present a new joint agreement at the December Board of Trustees meeting that will facilitate development of programs among the three colleges. The next Board of Directors meeting will be November 29\". o I attended the Southeast Regional Trustees meeting at Southeastern Illinois College last Thursday. Also in attendance from SCC were Vickie Artman, Jipaum Askew-Robinson, Tiffiney Ryan, and Gabrielle Farner. Matthew Berry, Legislative Liaison for the ICCB presented the program. O We will host a dedication ceremony for the veterans monument that was moved from the Foundation Housing and is now located in the area between the front parking lot and the gym. The fenced area also has benches and will be designated as an outdoor study area dedicated to our veterans. The ceremony will take place Saturday, November 12\" at 2:00 p.m. followed by a luncheon for veterans and a basketball game at 3:00. Veterans in attendance will also be recognized at the game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA motion was made by Mr. Don Patton and seconded by Ms. Maxine Russell to adjourn into executive session at 5:52 p.m. for the purpose of discussing:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1.

In accordance with these statutes and the concerns of the College for a safe environment and workplace, SCC has resolved to maintain a drug and alcohol free Workplace and thus has implemented a zero tolerance drug \u0026amp; alcohol policy, which is set forth as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following rules are extremely important and an employee who violates any one of them will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. Alcohol - An employee shall not possess, use, transfer, offer, or be under the influence of any intoxicating alcohol while at work or on company business. This rule prohibits using any alcohol prior to reporting to work, during breaks or meal periods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Drugs - An Employee may not possess, use, transfer, offer, share, attempt to sell or obtain, manufacture, or be under the influence of any drug or similar substance and also may not have any drugs or similar substances present in the body. Thus, an employee who tests positive for any illegaldrug violates this rule. This rule also pertains to prescription drugs being taken without doctor's authorization or without the proper prescription. An employee may not possess any type of contraband or paraphernalia that is associated or affiliated with the use, possession, distribution, manufacturing of any illegal substance or drug while on the premises of SCC, in any vehicle owned or controlled by SCC, or while conducting any job duty on behalf of SCC. 3. Prescriptions/ Over-the-counter Medications - It is the employees responsibility to check the potential\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eeffects of prescribed drugs and over-the counter medications with your doctor or pharmacists before starting work, and to immediately let your supervisor know when such use makes it unsafe for you to report to work or do your job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEmployees who are aware of the possession or use of alcohol or illegal drugs by another employee are required to report the matter to a Vice President, Dean or the Director of Human Resources.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePre-Employment Testing.

An employee who fails to cooperate in the administration of this policy may be terminated and such failure or refusal to cooperate may be considered a violation of this policy.

Employees are expected to cooperate in such searches. Searches of employees and their personal property may be conducted when there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is in violation of this policy. An employee's consent to such a search is required as a condition of employment and the employee's refusal to consent may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the test, the employee may be placed on an immediate suspension from work until the results are obtained. If suspended, the employee may be suspended with or without pay at SCC's sole discretion and subject to other requirements of SCC. Results shall be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with federal, state and/or local law. Employees subject to testing may request written test results, and in the event of a positive test, employees may request an explanation of the results in a confidential setting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf an employee's test is positive and reveals the employee is intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, prescribed or over-the-counter medications in excess of prescribed dosages, stimulants, amphetamines, barbiturates, or illegal drugs, the employee will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFailure of any employee to consent to testing when requested to do so will be considered insubordination and may result in disciplinary action against the employee, up to and including termination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSCC may also require all prospective employees to take and pass a pre-employment drug screening. If so, offers of employment are conditioned on the successful completion of the drug screening procedure.

In addition, the Board authorizes the Administration and its designees the right to remove any individual who appears to be under the influence of any controlled substance (drugs and/or alcohol) or who appears to be unduly under the influence of any legal or illegal drug impairing the immediate safety of the said individual or others participating in a College activity or while on College premises.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCertain fields of study require practical experiences which should be practiced without impaired judgment from drug or alcohol use. All students in health care and other required programs must pass a drug screening test before entering their practicum/clinical/externship as well as be subject to random testing throughout their program. Students may also be tested should there be reasonable suspicion that illegal use of any controlled substance (drugs and/or alcohol) or the abuse of legal drugs has occurred in such a manner in which an individual's ability to participate safely in an activity has been compromised or has comprised others attending or participating in the activity or on the College premises. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances that are consistent with short term effects of substance abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrior to enrollment in such educational programs deemed by the administration to require drug testing or participation in extracurricular activities, students must agree to participate in the drug screening program.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn roll call vote, the members voted as follows: Mr. Chris Boyd - yes\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr. Manul Goins – yes\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Steve Heisner - yes Mr. Don E.

The time, effort, and creativity you put into the fundraiser for me throughout the month of September was absolutely amazing. So many of you helped with activities, volunteering your time and hard work that I am in awe. And the generous monetary donations have just been overwhelming</p>

  <p>I cannot begin to tell you how much this outpouring of love and support means to me. I truly am blessed. I will always be extremely grateful to you all for helping to make a very difficult time much easier for me.</p>
    

  <p>So many people participated in one or more ways, but I would like to extend a very special thanks to Mindy Ashby, who came up with the idea and coordinated the fundraising project the entire month of September. Also, I would like to especially thank Leslie Weldon, Lee Ann George and her mother, Sandra Montgomery, Erica Poat and Stephanie Davault, Renee Wright, Latrina Spence, Jipaum Askew-Robinson, Dr. Tim Bellamy, Connie Lowery and the Cafeteria Staff, Coach John Sparks, Coach Howard Dillard, Michelle Bradley, and the wonderful SCC Students.</p>

The cost will be significantly different and the contractors that will be needed will be different depending on the required repairs. o Collected paperwork for removal of surplus items.

  <p>She will be attending the ICCTA SAC meeting in Naperville, IL later this week and will give a report at the next meeting.</p>

  <p>ICCTA REPORT</p>

  <p>Don Patton reported:</p>

  <p>Don and Manul Goins attended the Association of Community College Trustees Annual Congress in New Orleans October 6-8. Dr. Goins reported that the Congress was very beneficial and has one of the best trustee trainings you can get. Don reported that he attended a workshop regarding "students too distressed to learn'. Issues that affect Students learning includes food and housing security. These issues significantly affect students' mental health. Nationally the ratio of counselors to students at community college is 1 to 3,000. The ICCTA Board of Representatives will be meeting later this week in Naperville, IL.</p>

  <p>PRESIDENT'S REPORT</p>

  <p>Tim Bellamey's written report:</p>
    

  <p>I attended the Council of Presidents retreat on October 20" and 21" in Peoria. We received legal updates regarding community colleges. Among the items noted was Public Act 99-063, which limits outgoing boards of trustees from entering into a new employment agreement with a president, chancellor, or CEO, prior to the new board being sworn in. The blackout period begins 45 days prior to the Tuesday following the first Monday in April in oddnumbered years and extends until the first organizational meeting of the new board. There is an emergency exception to the new law. The new travel expense control act was also discussed. This law requires boards to set limits on travel reimbursements for meals, hotel, airfare, etc. Any expense above the limits must be approved by board action before the reimbursement will occurs. We are currently drafting our policy and will present it for approval at the December meeting. We also discussed the proposed bachelor of science in nursing for community colleges. It appears that ICCTA and ICCB support moving forward with legislation to allow community colleges to offer the BSN. I expect legislation will be proposed in the spring legislative session. The universities have indicated they will vigorously oppose this legislation so I the likelihood of passage is uncertain at best. I attended the SICCM Board of Directors meeting on October 25". We discussed at length options for the future operation of SICCM as well as the status of each program. Currently there are four programs operated through SICCM: Occupational Therapy Assistant, Surgical Technology, Medical Lab Technician, and Veterinary Technician. The Occupational Therapy program has the largest enrollment but the field is becoming saturated and employment options are declining. The Medical Lab Technician program is the highest demand field but enrollment is typically low. We have withdrawn from the Veterinary Technician program leaving only Rend Lake and John A. Logan active in the program. The feedback from hospitals regarding surgical technology is that they prefer training registered</p>
    

  <p>nurses for those jobs. In summary it appears the Veterinary Technology and Surgical Technology programs could be dropped leaving only the Occupational Therapy and Medical Laboratory Technician programs as viable options. I have indicated, as have the president's of Kaskaskia, Rend Lake, and Southeastern Illinois College that we cannot afford to financially support SICCM as it is currently constituted. We currently have class and program sharing agreements with SIC and Rend Lake that could allow us to provide joint programming should we decide not to continue as a member of the consortium in the future. These agreements can also be used to create new program opportunities. I will present a new joint agreement at the December Board of Trustees meeting that will facilitate development of programs among the three colleges. The next Board of Directors meeting will be November 29". o I attended the Southeast Regional Trustees meeting at Southeastern Illinois College last Thursday. Also in attendance from SCC were Vickie Artman, Jipaum Askew-Robinson, Tiffiney Ryan, and Gabrielle Farner. Matthew Berry, Legislative Liaison for the ICCB presented the program. O We will host a dedication ceremony for the veterans monument that was moved from the Foundation Housing and is now located in the area between the front parking lot and the gym. The fenced area also has benches and will be designated as an outdoor study area dedicated to our veterans. The ceremony will take place Saturday, November 12" at 2:00 p.m. followed by a luncheon for veterans and a basketball game at 3:00. Veterans in attendance will also be recognized at the game.</p>

  <p>A motion was made by Ms. Cathleen Belcher and seconded by Ms. Faith Diel to approve the changes to the Alcohol and Controlled Substances Compliance and Testing Policy #4381 as presented.</p>

  <p>ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES</p>

  <p>COMPLIANCE AND TESTING POLICY 4381</p>

  <p>Shawnee Community College desires to satisfy the requirements of the federal and state Drug Free Workplace Acts (41 USCA, 701 et seq. and 30 ILCS 580/1, et seq.) In accordance with these statutes and the concerns of the College for a safe environment and workplace, SCC has resolved to maintain a drug and alcohol free Workplace and thus has implemented a zero tolerance drug &amp; alcohol policy, which is set forth as follows:</p>

  <p>The following rules are extremely important and an employee who violates any one of them will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>

  <p>1. Alcohol - An employee shall not possess, use, transfer, offer, or be under the influence of any intoxicating alcohol while at work or on company business. This rule prohibits using any alcohol prior to reporting to work, during breaks or meal periods.</p>
    

  <p> Drugs - An Employee may not possess, use, transfer, offer, share, attempt to sell or obtain, manufacture, or be under the influence of any drug or similar substance and also may not have any drugs or similar substances present in the body. Thus, an employee who tests positive for any illegaldrug violates this rule. This rule also pertains to prescription drugs being taken without doctor's authorization or without the proper prescription. An employee may not possess any type of contraband or paraphernalia that is associated or affiliated with the use, possession, distribution, manufacturing of any illegal substance or drug while on the premises of SCC, in any vehicle owned or controlled by SCC, or while conducting any job duty on behalf of SCC. 3. Prescriptions/ Over-the-counter Medications - It is the employees responsibility to check the potential</p>

  <p>effects of prescribed drugs and over-the counter medications with your doctor or pharmacists before starting work, and to immediately let your supervisor know when such use makes it unsafe for you to report to work or do your job.</p>

  <p>Employees who are aware of the possession or use of alcohol or illegal drugs by another employee are required to report the matter to a Vice President, Dean or the Director of Human Resources.</p>

  <p>Pre-Employment Testing. All safety sensitive employees are required to pass a DOT pre-employment urine drug test upon hire or prior to being finally approved for hire. (Truck Driving Instructor &amp; Bus Drivers)</p>

  <p>Mandatory Post Accident Testing. Post accident drug and/or alcohol testing will be conducted when an accident with a college vehicle occurs. (This test may be waived at the President's discretion.)</p>

  <p>Random Drug Testing. All positions regulated under DOT will be required to submit to a random drug test.</p>

  <p>Reasonable Suspicion Testing or Reasonable Cause. The College reserves the right to request a urine or blood test sample from an employee in the event any of the following occurs:</p>

  <p>o Observable symptoms or unusual behavior by the employee;</p>
    

  <p>SCC reasonably suspects the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, based on objective symptoms, including but not limited to, factors related to the employee's appearance, behavior, speech, and/or other factors: The odor or smell of alcohol or drugs on the employee's breath or clothes or in an area (such as in a vehicle, office, work area, or restroom) immediately controlled or occupied by the employee; O Alcohol, alcohol containers, illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia in the employee's possession or in an area</p>

  <p>controlled or occupied by the employee (vehicle, office, desk or restroom); o Unexplained or significant deterioration in job performance;</p>

  <p>Unexplained significant changes in behavior (e.g., abusive behavior, repeated disregard of safety rules or procedures, insubordination, etc.); o Criminal citations, arrests or convictions involving drugs and alcohol;</p>

  <p>O Employee admissions regarding drug or alcohol use; o Any involvement in any work-related accident or near misses; O</p>

  <p>SCC reasonably suspects the employee has, or may have been involved in the use, possession, transfer, distribution, manufacture, and/or sale or drugs or alcohol in SCC controlled areas, on premises owned by SCC, while on duty, or while operating a vehicle or potentially dangerous equipment which is owned, leased or controlled by SCC, or while employee is acting on SCC's behalf: A test results in a finding of a dilute sample or reasonable suspicion that a sample has been tampered with will result in re-testing; or SCC has reason to believe an employee tampered with a previous urine or drug test.</p>

  <p>Duty to Cooperate. An employee who fails to cooperate in the administration of this policy may be terminated and such failure or refusal to cooperate may be considered a violation of this policy. This includes, but is not limited to, such things as:</p>

  <p>o Refusing to consent to testing, to submit a sample, or to sign required forms: o Refusing to cooperate in any way (for example, refusing to courteously and candidly cooperate in any</p>
    

  <p>interview or investigation, including any form of truthfulness, misrepresentation or misleading statements or omissions.); o Any form of dishonesty in the investigation or testing process.</p>

  <p>SCC reserves the right, at its sole and exclusive discretion, to conduct unannounced searches of its facilities and property for alcohol and/or illegal drugs. Employees are expected to cooperate in such searches. Searches of employees and their personal property may be conducted when there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is in violation of this policy. An employee's consent to such a search is required as a condition of employment and the employee's refusal to consent may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>

  <p>After the test, the employee may be placed on an immediate suspension from work until the results are obtained. If suspended, the employee may be suspended with or without pay at SCC's sole discretion and subject to other requirements of SCC. Results shall be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with federal, state and/or local law. Employees subject to testing may request written test results, and in the event of a positive test, employees may request an explanation of the results in a confidential setting.</p>

  <p>If an employee's test is positive and reveals the employee is intoxicated or under the influence of narcotics, prescribed or over-the-counter medications in excess of prescribed dosages, stimulants, amphetamines, barbiturates, or illegal drugs, the employee will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination.</p>
    

  <p>Failure of any employee to consent to testing when requested to do so will be considered insubordination and may result in disciplinary action against the employee, up to and including termination.</p>

  <p>SCC may also require all prospective employees to take and pass a pre-employment drug screening. If so, offers of employment are conditioned on the successful completion of the drug screening procedure. Transferred or promoted employees may be required to take and pass a subsequent drug test as a condition of transfer or promotion.</p>

  <p>Violation of any part of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and if appropriate, referral for prosecution by local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies.</p>

  <p>Recognizing that certain educational programs and/or activities expose students, participants, faculty, staff and observers to a greater risk of injury due to the nature of the activity, the Board authorizes the Administration and its designees the right to randomly test students/participants enrolled in such programs for the illegal use of any controlled substance or the use of legal substances impairing the ability of the student/participant to perform an activity or participate in any College sponsored event. In addition, the Board authorizes the Administration and its designees the right to remove any individual who appears to be under the influence of any controlled substance (drugs and/or alcohol) or who appears to be unduly under the influence of any legal or illegal drug impairing the immediate safety of the said individual or others participating in a College activity or while on College premises.</p>
    

  <p>Certain fields of study require practical experiences which should be practiced without impaired judgment from drug or alcohol use. All students in health care and other required programs must pass a drug screening test before entering their practicum/clinical/externship as well as be subject to random testing throughout their program. Students may also be tested should there be reasonable suspicion that illegal use of any controlled substance (drugs and/or alcohol) or the abuse of legal drugs has occurred in such a manner in which an individual's ability to participate safely in an activity has been compromised or has comprised others attending or participating in the activity or on the College premises. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances that are consistent with short term effects of substance abuse.</p>

  <p>Prior to enrollment in such educational programs deemed by the administration to require drug testing or participation in extracurricular activities, students must agree to participate in the drug screening program.</p>

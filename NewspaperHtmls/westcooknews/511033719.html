  <p>PROPOSED RESOLUTION</p>

  <p>IN SUPPORT OF DR. WILLIE WILSON AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT PUBLIC-PRIVATE FUND TO PAY THE BOND FOR NON-VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND SUPPORT THEIR REINTEGRATION INTO THE COMMUNITY</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, Dr. Willie Wilson bailed out six non-violent detainees from the Cook County Jail in September of 2016; and,</p>
    

  <p>WHEREAS, those six individuals were being held for minor offenses and could not make bail, meaning they would have remained in the Cook County Jail until their trial ended; and,</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, in November of 2016, Dr. Wilson plans to use $100,000 of his own money to bail out non-violent offenders so they will be able to spend this Thanksgiving with their families; and,</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, this is the latest in a long line of philanthropic efforts Dr. Wilson has made to improve life for Chicagoans; and,</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, Cook County Corrections facilities currently hold in excess of 300 inmates who are only incarcerated because they cannot afford to pay their bond; and,</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the bond amount for the aforementioned individuals is $1,000.00 or less; and,</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, approximately 55 percent of these individuals are currently being held on misdemeanor charges that carry a maximum imprisonment penalty of 364 days in a County Detention Facility; and,</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, Dr. Wilson’s selfless act in September of 2016 has saved taxpayers thousands of dollars, and his similarly planned initiative for Thanksgiving will save much more; and,</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, Dr. Wilson serves as an outstanding mentor for formerly incarcerated individuals, as he has come from humble roots to build a multi-million dollar business; and,</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners ought to follow in Dr. Wilson’s footsteps and advocate with haste for bail reform that will enable low-level detainees to not waste their lives in the Cook County Jail as they await trial;</p>

  <p>NOW, THEREFORE, LET IT BE RESOLVED, that the President of the Cook County Board and the Cook County Board of Commissioners support the efforts of Dr. Willie Wilson to mitigate the worst impacts of excessive bail bond fees; and,</p>

  <p>PROPOSED RESOLUTION</p>

  <p>CHAIR OF HONOR RECOGNIZING AMERICAN PRISONERS OR WAR AND MISSING IN ACTION</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, since the founding of our nation, millions of courageous men and women have answered the call to defend democracy both at home and abroad, and many have made the ultimate sacrifice in the fight for freedom, liberty and peace; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, we support the valiant efforts of our men and women who serve in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard and hope for their safe return at all times; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, there are currently 83,204 unaccounted for U.S. personnel, including 73,547 from World War II, 7,883 from the Korean War, 126 from the Cold War, 1,642 from the Vietnam War, and six from Iraq and other recent conflicts, according to the Pentagon's Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Person Office; and</p>
    

  <p>WHEREAS, residents of Cook County owe an incredible debt to those men and women who have fought on behalf of this country to protect the principles of our great nation, including those residents of Cook County who bravely served in our country’s Armed Forces and never returned home; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the service and sacrifice of prisoners of war and those missing in action is a testament to their love of country and their commitment to defending our nation; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, we urge the U.S. government to never give up pursuing the safe return of all POWs and MIAs; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the creation of a POW/MIA chair in the Cook County Board Room will be a reminder that many American prisoners of war were left behind after previous wars and many other military personnel were missing in action. The chair also will enable the County Board Members to pay tribute to those individuals who made such a great sacrifice for their country; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the establishment of a POW/MIA chair will properly acknowledge the past and protect future Veterans from being left behind should they become prisoners of war or go missing in action; and</p>

  <p>NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that the</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, a class action lawsuit was filed on October 14, 2016 alleging that pre-trial detainees are detained at Cook County jail solely because they are unable to pay the amount of money fixed as a financial condition of their release; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the class action lawsuit also alleges that reliance on monetary bond results in a disparate impact on African Americans that constitutes illegal race discrimination in violation of the Illinois Civil Rights Act; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, Cook County jail receives over 70,000 admissions every year; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, 8,248 individuals were being detained at Cook County Jail as of October 17, 2016; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, studies have shown that pre-trial detention is more expensive than the pre-trial supervision programs that allow individuals to return to their communities and continue working; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, judges have the discretion to set bond based on individual factors and these decisions determine whether an individual will remain in the community and continue to work and attend school, or remain incarcerated; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, judges are required by the Code of Criminal Procedure to consider more than 30 statutory factors pertaining to the nature of the charge(s) against the defendant, his or her criminal history, prior instances of failure to appear, and the defendant's home and community information, such as place of residence, family ties, employment, education, character, and mental condition; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, judicial decisions on bonds and release conditions varies considerably by judge; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, judges spend approximately 37 seconds and sometimes as few as 10 seconds listening to information on the charged arrest and any mitigating factors before determining bond; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, as a matter of practice, judges impose financial conditions without making an inquiry into and findings concerning a defendant’s ability to pay the amount ordered; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the average bond amounts set by judges are out of reach for the majority of pre-trial detainees; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the monetary bond was $71,878, yet the median household income in Cook County is $54,648; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, African Americans are disproportionately detained on monetary bonds through their pretrial period; and</p>
    

  <p>WHEREAS, between the years 2011 and 2013, only 15.8% of African Americans charged with a Class 4 felony were released on bond, while 32.4% of non-African Americans charged with a Class 4 felony were released on bond; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, other jurisdictions, such as Washington D.C., have successfully ended the reliance on monetary bond and have established non-monetary alternatives; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, a number of other jurisdictions do not detain arrestees prior to trial solely on lack of ability to pay and instead employ pre-trial supervision programs that often achieve court-appearance rates of over 90%; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, mounting research has shown alternatives to detention such as text message reminder systems, drug and mental health treatment, unsecured bond and supervised release successfully ensure future court appearances; and</p>

  <p>October 26, 2016 Board of Commissioners BOARD AGENDA</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, in Washington, D.C., where nearly 90 percent of defendants are released without monetary bond, 88 percent make all of their court appearances and 89 percent do not have any new arrests during the pretrial phase; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, a 2013 study of 2,000 criminal cases in Colorado found that defendants released on personal recognizance are just as likely to return to court and just as likely to reoffend as those with monetary bonds; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the Federal court system ended reliance on monetary bond in 1966; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, since 2015, five federal courts have found that their local bond systems are unconstitutional; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Justice recognized in a 2015 friend of the court brief that, “incarcerating individuals solely because of their inability to pay for their release...violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”</p>
    

  <p>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby request that a hearing of the Criminal Justice Committee be convened to call on experts to provide statistical data and evidence of unconstitutional practices as well as information on alternatives to monetary bond.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p><b><b><b><b><b></b></b></b></b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>a. To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the industrial or commercial use.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>b. The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being associated through a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation, except for an employee who worked for an owner, as defined herein, that operated the site. A present owner or employer who can successfully demonstrate that the owner or employer was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.</b></b></p>
    

  <p><b><b>c. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification. A copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>d. To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter". Where an application for Class C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been completed, the one-year limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven years.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>e. Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs, including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring, and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>f. The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:</b></b></p>
    

  <p>1. The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;</p>

  <p>2. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class C; and</p>

  <p>3. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office</p>

  <p>of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16-percent assessment level period.</p>

  <p>The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the effected districts.</p>
    

  <p>g. If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.</p>

  <p>h. For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.</p>

  <p>i. The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under the Class C classification.</p>

  <p>j. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non- filing.</p>
    

  <p>(9) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this Division, including&nbsp;<b><b>the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.

  <p><b><b>a. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a.

  <p><b><b>c. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7a recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7a site.

  <p><b><b><b><b><b><b></b></b></b></b></b></b><b></b></p>
    

  <p>a. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7b application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:</p>

  <p>A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not&nbsp;been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or</p>

  <p>B. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been&nbsp;vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.</p>

  <p><b></b>Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.<b></b></p><b>

  <p>c. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7b site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non- filing.</p>
    

  <p>(11) Class 7c or Commercial Urban Relief Eligibility ("CURE"). Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.</p>

  <p>a. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that:</p>

  <p>(i) The property, site, or area is deemed a redevelopment priority by the municipality, and</p>

  <p>(ii) The municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 7c is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7c application to the Assessor.</p>

  <p>In order to determine Class 7c applications, an application for Class 7c shall be submitted to the Assessor and the Bureau of Economic Development. Upon receipt of the application and all the necessary supporting data, the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County, within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present. The Assessor shall review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment under this Division.</p>
    

  <p>Where the Economic Development Advisory Committee does not return a finding stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present within 30 days, and upon further application of the requesting party, the Assessor may review the application, supporting data, and other appropriate facts and certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment and grant the incentive.</p>

  <p>(1) That the Property's (the real estate that is subject of the Incentive application) Assessed Value, Equalized Assessed Value or Real estate taxes for three of the last six years, have declined or remained stagnant due to the depressed condition;</p>

  <p>(2) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted Class 7c designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the property;</p>

  <p>(3) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation will materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property and the commercial development property would not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7c; and</p>

  <p>(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation is reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities of the property.</p>

  <p>b. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 7c eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 7c. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant may instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.</p>

Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting of land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract renewal. The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number of Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>a. Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed&nbsp;<b><b>pursuant to one of the following alternatives:</b></b></b></b></p>

  <p></p>

  <p>1. HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market</p>

  <p>option, after finding that:</p>

  <p>i. The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an inspection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS) violations;</p>

  <p>ii. The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot be eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase the rents to the use restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and</p>

  <p>iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable</p>

  <p>market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.</p>

  <p>2. HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property meets at least one of the required criteria:</p>

  <p>i. A vulnerable population is affected,</p>

  <p>ii. There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance</p>

  <p>difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or</p>

  <p>iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a</p>

  <p><b><b><b><b><b>contribution of state or local funds to the property.</b></b></b></b></b></p><b><b><b>
    

  </b></b><p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>3. HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>b. Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>1. At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low- and&nbsp;</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>moderate-income persons.</b></b></p>

  <p></p>

  <p><b><b>2. The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at</b></b></p>

  <p></p>

  <p>least five years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.</p>

  <p>3. For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement verifying continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this Division.</p>

  <p>4. Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is terminated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's office a copy of any notice of default or notice of abatement received from HUD.</p>
    

  <p>c. When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days prior to the expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's Office of the application, on a form provided by that office. Upon receiving approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the applicant shall file an application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by that office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter approving the contract renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.</p>

  <p>d. Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a mark up to market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001 assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.</p>

  <p>Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8 contract renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark up to market option under HUD's discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.</p>
    

  <p><b><b><b><b><b>e. The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the following three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option under HUD's discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to&nbsp;</b></b></b></b></b>termination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract renewal, or notification of other action.</p>

Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this Division; is a landmark or contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation must constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market value as determined by the Assessor in the assessment year prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>a. Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor, the land upon which the building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>b. Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an Ordinance or Resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located, which expressly states that the local government:</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>c. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the time the Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or Resolution must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>d. If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed, the applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:</b></b></p>

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>f. Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the determination of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.</b></b></p>

  <p><b><b>g. The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such&nbsp;substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.<b><b><b></b></b></b></b></b></p>

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class L; and</p>

  <p>3. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office</p>

  <p>of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.</p>

  <p>The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts.</p>

  <p>i. If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out &nbsp;over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.</p>

  <p><b><b><b><b></b></b></b></b><b><b><b><b></b></b></b></b></p>
    

  <p><b><b>j. For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial Class L incentive will expire.

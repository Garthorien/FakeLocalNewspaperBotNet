A Resolution authorizing the Mayor and City Clerk to execute Licensing Agreements for 2017 permit approved applications for use of public right-of-way or City-owned property. (Chris Mathias, Property Management Coordinator) Explanation: For the last three years, the City Council has passed a resolution to allow for staff to administer and approve all licensing agreements and for the Mayor and City Clerk to execute approved licensing agreements without each agreement being presented to the City Council. Staff feels that the process change has worked well. Customers do not have to wait three weeks for Council approval. Staff is recommending approval of a resolution for 2017 similar to what was passed in previous years. Additional documentation attached. Staff Recommendation: Approval Fiscal impact: N/A Public Notice/Recording: N/A Goals Impacted: Upgrade City Infrastructure \u0026amp; Facilities 2. A Resolution authorizing the Mayor and City Clerk to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement between the City of Moline, Illinois and the Illinois Department of Transportation for the purpose of collaborating on the development of the Avenue of the Cities Corridor Plan. (Jeff Anderson, City Planner) Explanation: The Avenue of the Cities Corridor Plan would emphasize multimodal functionality, economic viability, ADA accessibility, urban design, and integration with the community’s existing transportation system and neighborhood framework throughout the Avenue of the Cities/23rd Avenue corridor running from Moline’s border with Rock Island to Moline’s border with East Moline. The cost is estimated to be $100,000. The City of Moline will be responsible for $20,000 of that cost, which has been included in the 2017 budget. Additional documentation attached.

A Resolution authorizing approval of a Reconciliation Change Order with Walter D. Laud, Inc. for Project #1247, 2016 Residential Reconstruction Program, in the amount of $226,188.61. (Scott Hinton, City Engineer) Explanation: Project #1247 includes the reconstruction of 14th Street from 18th to 19th Avenues and 24th Avenue from 6th to 7th Streets with a new water main, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer. In order to make final payment to the contractor and close out the contract, a change order is needed in the amount of $226,188.61. The change order reflects an increase of $8,839.01 between the estimated bid quantities and final quantities actually constructed and includes $217,349.60 worth of additional pavement patching requested by Council with funds originally allocated to the 40th Street project. Additional documentation attached. Staff Recommendation: Approval.

A Resolution authorizing approval of a Reconciliation Change Order with Langman Construction, Inc. for Project #1246, Alley Reconstruction between 4th and 5th Avenues and 7th and 8th Streets, in the amount of $30,117.72. (Scott Hinton, City Engineer) Explanation: In order to make final payment to the contractor and close out the contract, a change order is needed in the amount of $30,117.72. The change order reflects the difference between the estimated bid quantities and final quantities actually constructed. The change order increases the original contract value of $270,366.50 by 11.1% to $300,484.22. The majority of the additional cost is related to the existing sanitary sewer being located deeper in the ground than City records indicated. The new sanitary sewer had to be installed deeper than planned resulting in rock excavation and additional trench backfill. Additional documentation attached. Staff Recommendation: Approval.

Schulte, Scott Hinton, Tony Loete, Jeff Anderson, Shawn Christ Completed: ? Hawk Hollow: Commencement/near completion of first building; anticipate starting two additional buildings Winter 2016 which will provide 9 of the 15 units in the development ? Spiegel building: Developer started and is working on a plan for 39 apartment units and a café in the first floor addition to the south ? 6th Avenue lot: City staff is working with a developer interested in building 64 townhouse style units on vacant land located between 12th and 14th Street on the south side of 6th Avenue ?

Residential South of Rock River: • Completed utility loop around airport • Created more accurate maps of City-owned farms and location of completed utilities • Committee met to analyze the location of City-owned land, topography and distance to utilities and determined that the Bealer Farm (NE corner of 100th Avenue and 50th Street) is the most ideal location to kick start residential development south of the Rock River • City staff met with the Quad City Realtor Association, the local Home Builders Association and local financing professionals to assess their opinions on the Illinois residential housing market • Advantages: City already owns land outright, land price on Illinois side is lower than Iowa, scenic views • Disadvantages: Illinois business climate/lack of new housing, two of City farms are located in Rock Island School District, farms are probably too big for one developer or builder to complete so it may have to be done piece meal or with the City as the developer • Marketing toward empty nesters or adults without children on the Bealer Farm property may be most suitable • A full water utility study of the south Rock area is estimated at over $200,000; City staff will therefore try and study hydraulic needs in-house • Estimates have been requested by local engineering firms to complete the necessary design documents for the Bealer property which has been preliminarily designed and a plat created; minor adjustments to the plat have been recommended by the Home Builders and Quad City Realtors Associations • Staff is working on a comprehensive report to present to City Council to seek clear direction on moving forward CITY COUNCIL GOALS AND PRIORITIES – COMMITTEE UPDATES December 13, 2016 Page 4 of 4 Upcoming: ?

Cash contributions to the Program from third parties must be accounted for in the general ledger with other Grant Funds. Third party in-kind (non-cash) contributions are not required to be recorded in the general ledger, but must be under accounting control, possibly through the use of a memorandum ledger. See 2 CFR 200.302. (b) Source Documentation. Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as canceled checks, bank statements, invoices, paid bills, donor letters, time and attendance records, activity reports, travel reports, contractual and consultant agreements, and subaward documentation. All supporting documentation should be clearly identified with the Award and general ledger accounts which are to be charged or credited. (i) The documentation standards for salary charges to grants are prescribed by 2 CFR 200.430, and in the cost principles applicable to the entity’s organization (Paragraphs 7.4 through 7.5).

The reports must be signed by the employee, approved by the appropriate official, and coincide with a pay period. These time records should be used to record the distribution of salary costs to the appropriate accounts no less frequently than quarterly.

Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all cash, real and personal property, and other assets. Grantee must adequately safeguard all such property and must provide assurance that it is used solely for authorized purposes.

Residential South of Rock River: • Completed utility loop around airport • Created more accurate maps of City-owned farms and location of completed utilities • Committee met to analyze the location of City-owned land, topography and distance to utilities and determined that the Bealer Farm (NE corner of 100th Avenue and 50th Street) is the most ideal location to kick start residential development south of the Rock River • City staff met with the Quad City Realtor Association, the local Home Builders Association and local financing professionals to assess their opinions on the Illinois residential housing market • Advantages: City already owns land outright, land price on Illinois side is lower than Iowa, scenic views • Disadvantages: Illinois business climate/lack of new housing, two of City farms are located in Rock Island School District, farms are probably too big for one developer or builder to complete so it may have to be done piece meal or with the City as the developer • Marketing toward empty nesters or adults without children on the Bealer Farm property may be most suitable • A full water utility study of the south Rock area is estimated at over $200,000; City staff will therefore try and study hydraulic needs in-house • Estimates have been requested by local engineering firms to complete the necessary design documents for the Bealer property which has been preliminarily designed and a plat created; minor adjustments to the plat have been recommended by the Home Builders and Quad City Realtors Associations • Staff is working on a comprehensive report to present to City Council to seek clear direction on moving forward CITY COUNCIL GOALS AND PRIORITIES – COMMITTEE UPDATES December 13, 2016 Page 4 of 4 Upcoming: ?

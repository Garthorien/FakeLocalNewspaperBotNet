  <p>Living Wage Ordinance Compliance Affidavit Provided: Yes</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial facility; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months, have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the property is deemed abandoned; and</p>
    

  <p>WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon purchase for value; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific real estate. The municipal resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of abandoned with special circumstances; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying industrial real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and</p>

  <p>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the above-captioned property is deemed abandoned with special circumstances under the Class 6b; and</p>

  <p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward a certified copy of this resolution to the Office of the Cook County Assessor</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial facility; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months, have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and</p>
    

  <p>WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the property is deemed abandoned; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific real estate. The municipal resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of abandoned with special circumstances; and</p>

  <p>WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying industrial real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and</p>

  <p>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the above-captioned property is deemed abandoned with special circumstances under the Class 6b; and</p>
